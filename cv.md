My main goal at the moment is to work in the IT. On the advice of my fellow programmers, I decided to enroll in Rolling Scopes School. In a quite short period of time, I was able to successfully complete a basic course in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Knowledge in this field of IT interested me and carried away, and now I spend almost all my free time to learn programming. I am a multitasking, hardworking and inquisitive person, I like to solve complex problems and to find out how something is working.
